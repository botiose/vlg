Bounding Eccentricities
Very Large Graphs
Abstract
This paper is a summary of our research and development of the Bounding Eccentricities algorithm introduced in the 2013 article Computing the Eccentricity Distribution of Large Graphs
by Frank W. Takes and Walter A. Kosters. In this report we restate all of the methodologies
from the original paper that were applied during the implementation of the Bounding Eccentricities algorithm, as well as any other external concepts originating from other research on
the same topic. We also show the results of various experiments using the same performance
measures as in the original paper for the sake of simplifying comparison. Additionally, we also
show the relative improvement brought forth by of all of the main methodologies introduced in
the paper over previous versions, namely selection strategies and graph prunning.

Experiments

In this section we present some performance analysis of our implementation of this algorithm. To
assess the performance of our implementation with respect to the results found in section 6 of the
paper [1] we provide some of the same performance analysis. We have thus measured the number
of execution of our shortest path search algorithm required to compute all of the eccentricities. In
this section we shall first analyse the performance of the different selection strategies as well as
the graph prunning strategy given in the paper. The number of iteration taken after the implementation of each method presented in the respect columns for the ca-CondMat, ca-HepPh and
ca-HepTh is given in the following table:

The best performing variant was evaluated on 3 more datasets of higher sizes. The following table
shows the results:

Conclusion

We have thus implemented the algorithm and have found very similar results for each of the
graphs used in the paper. We also have seen the relative improvement of each optimization method
proposed in the reasearch paper. However, there are still some improvements that can be performed.
A possible route for improvement would be to find a better candidate selection method, however
this would require more research to be performed. Another route for improvement that would
require less effort would be to parallelise the shortest path computations to leverage as most as
possible multiple core systems which are much more popular today than they were in 2013.
